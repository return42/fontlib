The python fontlib_ package helps to manage fonts from different resources.  A
:ref:`Font <font>` itself is identified by its origin URL.  Fonts from various
resources (URLs) are organized in a :ref:`FontStack <fontstack>`.  You can setup
a FontStack individual, but for the first the ``fontlib`` command has some handy
defaults for you.  Jump directly to chapter :ref:`get_started` to get in touch with
fontlib's command line.
